        <h2>Details of the Quiz</h2>
        <h3> The Organisation :</h3>
        <p>Aryabhat Foundation is a dedicated endeavor for promotion of Astronomy and Basic Science. The movement
          started in 1995, which took the shape of a duly registered social service organisation. Backed by a group of
          people
          dedicated to their duties towards society, the organisation is committed to make learning Basic Science
          enjoyable for youngsters, thus inculcating a science-based temperament in them.</p>

        <h3>The Program :</h3>
        <p>Astronomy is a thrilling hobby for all age groups. It also makes a strong platform for youngsters aspiring
          for an exciting career in space technology.</p>
        <p>Aryabhat Astronomy Quiz is aimed at developing the interest of the
          school students in this field through practical exposure. The quiz is a two-tier competition consisting of a
          preliminary test followed by a practical examination. The preliminary test is a cream-separation exercise
          conducted on a digital platform.</p>
        <p>Selected participants will qualify for the secondary level by merit in the
          preliminary test. These participants will be offered training in telescope-operation, sky reading and
          practical Astronomy at our Bhopal Centre. The lodging-boarding will be free for participants availing night
          camps, but no TA/DA will be paid at any stage. Those who fail to attend the training will not be included for
          the secondary level.</p>
        <p>The secondary level examination will be held on Saturday 26 December 2026. This test is
          meant to examine the ability of the participants in practical Astronomy. Final winners will be selected on
          their overall performance.</p>

        <h3>Eligibility :</h3>
        <p>Students from class 6 to class 9 (both inclusive) from any school situated in Madhya Pradesh are eligible to
          take part in the quiz. Students availing home-schooling in the given class range and permanently residing in
          Madhya Pradesh are also eligible.</p>

        <h3>Entry Fee :</h3>
        <p>Waived for all participants. No charges will be there for practical training as well.</p>

        <h3>Preliminary Test :</h3>
        <p>The preliminary Quiz consists of questions on basic Astronomy & Space Science. Each participant is offered 20
          objective type questions to be answered in 180 seconds. A correct answer will fetch five marks, and two marks
          will be deducted for the wrong one. The final score will appear on-screen as soon as any participant finishes
          the test.</p>
        <p>For individual participants, the preliminary Quiz will be available online on the allotted date and
          time. For institutional participants, the Quiz will be offered on the school’s computers on a date and time
          settled with the school, in presence of a person authorised by Aryabhat. In addition, Aryabhat would also
          conduct the Preliminary Test at common test centres.

          Institutional-mode, or vice-versa.</p>
